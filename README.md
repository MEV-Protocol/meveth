### Docs

To build the docs locally, run `docs-build`. The output will be inside of `./result`.

Run `docs-serve` to serve the docs locally (after building them previously). You can edit the docs in `./docs`.

### Running tests

To run all tests, you can use `check` (alias for `nix flake check`); it will build all packages and run all tests.

You can use `tests -h` to execute a specific test, which will provide more information.

### Formatting

You can manually format the source using the `fmt` command.
